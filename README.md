Implementation / learning example of querying an InfluxDB database using InfluxDB-Python


## About

This repo holds a simple script to query an InfluxDB database.
It uses two of the classes from [InfluxDB-Python](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-python) library.
Both use the same query, but one returns JSON and the other returns a pandas DataFrame.
These are both simple examples, but enough to show a quick proof-of-concept.
